        <li><h4>User Survey and Data Analysis to uncover Insights</h4></li>
        <p>
          The first form of user research conducted was a Blackboard user survey, created and circulated to ten direct users of Blackboard. The survey was circulated to primarily University Computer Science students all of varying ages and year of study. The aim of said survey was to gain an general oversight of its regular users, their habits and reasons for use, frustrations they encounter in completing these day to day tasks in improvements they wish to see to easier complete their these common task.

        <li><h4>Mind Mapping - Businnes golas vs user goals</h4></li>
        <p>
          A mind mapping exercise was conducted to further gather ideas and visualise what was what was genuinely important when e-learning/Virtual Learning Environments are concerned. The mind mapping exercises contained two main ideas; What was important to Virtual Learning Environments in gen- eral, what is important to the user. It is important to align these both ideas of the user and ideas of the business/service of which the users are engaging with.

        <li><h4>User Personas</h4></li>
        <p>A set of user personas were then created from the data gathered from the Blackboard User Survey. The personas is intended to outline a typical and or potential user of a Virtual Learning Environment in particular Blackboard.</p>

        <p>The usability testing conducted for this UX case study was that of direct user testing in laboratory conditions. A Lab based think aloud protocol test will form the initial phase of user testing and will be based on the existing user interface of Blackboard to uncover outstanding usability issues.</p>
